        <h2>How to choose a surfboard?</h2>
        <hr/>
        <p>
You probably already know what a surfboard is :) without it we are actually half human and in general can not surf ... 
but there are some other interesting questions like where did it develop from? What types of surfboards are there? How much does a surfboard cost?
And most importantly - how to choose a surfboard? Today we will answer all these questions (and a few more…) so that you can enter the water as quickly as possible
to surf and enjoy.
        </p>
        <h2>What is the surfboard made of (with some history)? </h2>
        <p>
More than 252 years ago, some guys were sitting on a beach in Hawaii, looking at the stunning sea and thinking - maybe you can surf and see all this beauty from the inside? 
So they took some wooden planks and put them together and basically did not know they had made the first surfboard and made history.
Over the years, the surfing industry has developed greatly and of course the production of surfboards has also undergone a significant upgrade. 
The truth is that every year there are innovations and developments in the field, the new design is inspired by the first surfboards 
but with the thought and upgrade of professional shapers.
        </p>
        <p>
The surfboard is made of hardened foam (a certain type of styrofoam) fiberglass (fiberglass) and wood (the spine in the case and it exists), 
the fiberglass covers the foam strengthens and hardens it. The fiberglass is glued with polyester or epoxy which are strong and very durable materials
that harden the outside, how strong? Let's say this is a material used in aircraft construction.
        </p>
        <h2>So what is the basic structure of the surfboard?</h2>
        <p>
 Each surfboard is divided into several parts with the front part being called the nose and the back being stern. In general longer surfboards are faster and spin less,
and short surfboards are better rotated but slower so gannets are longer and narrower and hold high speeds.
            </p>
            <p>
 Deck (thin) - the central part of the surfboard on which the surfer stands while surfing or lying down as he paddles forward. You have probably heard that surfers 
 put wax, not in a section of a tribute to the John Travolta hairstyle but on the surfboard itself - the wax is placed to create a better grip and prevent slipping 
 on the surfboard (we will expand a bit on wax for the surfboard later).
                <br>
 There are two types of thinners:
                <br>
<strong>1)</strong> domed deck or in Hebrew "Dome Deck" - it is easy to recognize that when you look at the nose of the surfboard you can see a slight curvature upwards, this is what helps in fast movement from rail to rail. <br>
<strong>2)</strong> flat deck we will not leave you in suspense :) As its name implies - a flat deck.</p>
                <p>
  Nose is the part above the water - in general it can be said that in shortboard, gun, and nose fish surfboards it is usually pointed and in minimal
 panboard and longboard surfboards it is rounded. Some skiers put on the nose of the surfboard (nose guard) to prevent explosions in this sensitive area 
(these will also be the skiers who will usually make sure to surf with a hat for protection from the sun or the cold).
                </p>
                <p>
Tail - The most important part of a surfboard, it will determine its ability to rotate along with its length, width and volume. 
Here too it will be easy to guess that its location is the back of the surfboard. There are different shapes of the tail,
so each shape allows for a different performance while surfing. There are several different forms of stern,
the base is the stern of the squash and penis all other forms are a hybrid of these two forms.
There are all kinds of combinations such as: Fish, Round, Swallow, Diamond and more ..
                </p>
                <p>
Rails are the edges of the surfboard, basically its entire outer shape - from the tail to the nose and the connection between the trigger and the bottom. 
Stringer This is a strip with a hard material (usually made of wood) that is found along the entire length of the foam in the surfboard. Epoxy,
soft and carbon fiber surfboards will usually be without stringers.
                </p>
                <h2>After understanding a bit about the surfboard we finally got to the question: which surfboard is right for me?!</h2>
                <p>
 So as you have already understood in order to choose the surfboard of your dreams you should know what types of surfboards there are... we are here to make you order!
So like that, there are windsurfers, windsurfers (for beginners there are boogiebacks), surfers for kite surfing and even surfboards for kids (and what fun for those who started surfing at an early age).
                    <br/>                    
Close your eyes and imagine a perfect day of surfing in the sea, now open them and keep reading so you can make your dream come true :)
                    <br/>
So in order to choose the right board for you, you should consider the size, shape and volume. The first thing that matters is the 
maneuverability of the surfboard - the intention is how much it allows you to turn around, change the direction of surfing and more.            
 In order to improve your performance in the fastest way you will check what works best for your weight and level of surfing.</p>
                <p>
Your buoyancy - the volume of the surfboard will determine how much the surfboard will flood us with water,
how is this reflected in surfing? The more the surfboard floods you the less effort you will put in as you paddle your wave.
 The faster you can move and paddle the faster you will catch waves even if they are not very clean (without a current wind and chops) and easy to catch 
 like in Israel for example. But the volume of the surfboard is not the whole story, it is important to also include the weight of the surfer in the decision 
 and here it is quite simple - the heavier the surfer has, the volume of the surfboard will suit him and vice versa.
                </p>
                <p>
It is important not to confuse the dimensions with the volume (Volume) - in the picture above you can see the same dimensions on surfboards with different volumes. 
Surfing on each such surfboard will be different. Usually the calculation is to divide the weight of the surfer with the volume of the surfboard - the bigger the result 
the smaller the surfboard will be in relation to the same surfer of course, 
if it is a boy with a slim structure or a sturdy mature surfer it will affect the surfboard size respectively. <br/>
How will you know what the volume of the surfboard is? The truth is that today it is very simple, you will see clear tables on the websites of the leading surfing companies and also the caption on the surfboards themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>Here is a division for choosing the surfboard according to comfort and level of surfing:</h2>
                <p>
Beginner level 1 - flat water, learn to stand on the surfboard .. The ideal surfboard will be a soft board, made of soft sponge and will allow safe and fun learning. <br/>
Beginner level 2 - rowing deep and passing waves, descending a straight wave. Soft board is still recommended. <br/>
Advanced level 1 - learn to catch a corner (go down the wave to the side), here you actually really start to glide on the power of the wave.
 The soft will still fit but you can switch to a hard fiberglass fanboard. <br/>
 Advanced Level 2 - Begin to learn to gain speed and make turns from rail to rail. <br/>
 Advanced Level 3 - Surfing Top to Bottom, as it is called from the bottom up, make sharp turns on the wave and really draw on it :) <br/>
 Pro level (professionals at the highest level) - do everything from everything, air pipes and surf in varied and difficult surfing conditions. <br/>
