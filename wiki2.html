        <h2>let's start!</h2>
        <p>
       So since we know how hard surfing learning can be,
 we decided to give you some super important tips to help you get through your first steps in surfing on the best side.
       </p>
       <h2><strong>1) first thing first </strong> Only surfing training brings perfection </h2>
     <p>you will reach the sea as much as possible to surf
As with everything in life, and especially in the world of sports. In order to get better at what you do,
 understand it and be a professional in the field, you need to practice as much as possible. Behind every great athlete or surfer you see at sea,
 there are many hours of training at sea on the surfboard, and on land in improving his physical fitness.
     </p>
     <p>
    If you do not reach the sea every time there are waves, it will be very difficult for you to constantly improve and reach a state where you manage in the sea on your own,
     catching full of waves and kicking out of life. The body needs to get used to so many new things that surfing brings with it such as: rowing while lying on the surfboard, 
     crossing the waves, where it is best to sit to catch the wave, moving from lying to standing and more. Therefore, in order to reach a high level of surfing,
      one should spend as much time as possible in training and practicing all the new elements that the body and mind need to get used to in order to be good surfers.
       How many hours a week should you exercise? The best answer would be as much as possible. As a beginner you want to spend as much time as possible in the water knowing the sea and the surfing conditions,
 and practicing rowing and surfing as much as possible.
    </p>
        <p>Even if you have reached the sea and there are no waves, it is not terrible, you can still do a lot of things at sea that will help you become better surfers and improve your 
            surfing ability. what? Do a run on the beach and practice lung endurance, get into rowing training on the surfboard to strengthen the muscles that participate in rowing 
            and improve your rowing ability, watch the sea and learn about the wind patterns, currents and shape of the beach.
        </p>
        <h2>2. Surf with someone more experienced</h2>
        <p>We are all already familiar with the well-worn phrase "no one is as smart as someone with experience." But in the case of surfing sports this sentence is particularly accurate and 
            correct. Veteran surfers, are not only more experienced in the subject of catching and riding waves, they also know the sea and its conditions better, know exactly
             where it is best to sit in the water to catch the waves with minimum effort. In addition, they know the beaches and the types of waves at each beach, know when it is best 
             to get to the sea to surf and when the waves are best for beginners and advanced.
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, if you surf with a veteran surfer of yours, he can also contribute to you from his vast experience and teach you a lot about sea and wave conditions.
                 And by watching it while surfing and asking questions along the way, you will get a lot of knowledge and help in and out of the water.
                  In addition, surfing with a more experienced surfer will give you a sense of security in the water,
                 and you will know that there is always someone experienced to help you in case of need in any problem you encounter.
                </p>
                <h2>3. Take a surfing lesson at a veteran and professional surfing club</h2>
                <p>In direct connection to what we explained in section 2, take a surfing lesson at a veteran club that will attach you to an experienced surfing instructor who can 
                    look at you in the water and give you feedback on rowing, surfing and the way you conduct yourself in the water. This is one of the things that can help you and
                     promote you significantly. Yes, surfing can be learned on your own. At the same time, because surfing requires you to do so many things together in the water
                      while you face a variety of challenges.
                </p>
                <p>Accompaniment of a close surfing guide can significantly improve your surfing in a shorter period of time, why? Because the surfing guide is always close to you, 
                    so it can also help you on the physical level to cross the waves and catch them. And he will also look at what you do in the water, analyze your movements and the
                     way you behave from the stage of entering the sea to the stage of catching the wave, and give you his professional point of view and the most important and 
                     relevant tips to understand For the same mistakes, get better at surfing and catching a lot more waves.
                 </p>
                 <h2>4. You should choose a surfboard that suits your level and your abilities</h2>
                 <p>Choosing a surfboard suitable for your abilities, your measurements and your level of surfing is one of the most important issues when starting to surf. 
                     Here too, consulting with experienced and experienced surfers from you, or getting professional advice at a surfing club, can make the difference between
                      purchasing a surfboard that you will be comfortable surfing with and will help you move forward correctly and safely. And a surfboard that is too small or 
                      too large to not fit your level and dimensions, and will cause you overexertion, great frustration and lack of progress and long-term improvement in your 
                      surfing level, to the point of wanting to retire from the field. So many times we have come across beginner surfers who have paid the best of their money 
                      and purchased a surfboard that just does not suit them. Which usually leads to a lot of frustration and a reluctance to continue in the sport.
